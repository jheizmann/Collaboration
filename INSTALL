Installation instructions for Collaboration extension v1.2
----------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

	MediaWiki 1.15.1 or higher
	Semantic Mediawiki 1.5
	Script Manager 1.0 or higher
	ParserFunctions
	Variables


Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install CE is using the deployment framework:

 smwadmin -i collaboration

This installs the extension.

For a manual installation, you have to copy the folder Collaboration into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. Collaboration will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

Activating Collaboration
------------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/Collaboration/includes/CE_Initialize.php');
enableCollaboration();

Import of the ontology
----------------------

The Collaboration extension comes with an own small ontology to provide functionality
for displaying and querying existing comments and some icons.

For that go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/Collaboration/import/collaboration.xml'

To use the delivered icons you need to upload the following files in your wiki:
'/extensions/Collaboration/skins/icons/bad_active.png'
'/extensions/Collaboration/skins/icons/neutral_active.png'
'/extensions/Collaboration/skins/icons/good_active.png'
'/extensions/Collaboration/skins/icons/defaultuser.gif'
'/extensions/Collaboration/skins/icons/Comment_icon_crystal.png'
Please be sure that you keep the original file names.

Now you can enter {{ShowComments|show=True}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related comments' and a form that allows you to enter new comments. 


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in /includes/CE_Initialize.php.

To reformat the style of existing comments or of the comment form, use the provided Cascading Style Sheet in '/skins' directory.


Notice
======
It's highly recommended that you do not change the css definitions for 'div.ce_result_user'
and img#ce-cf-user-img. They are among others used to downscale the user icon. Changing or deleting
these values could lead to unintended GUI results.
