Installation instructions for Collaboration extension v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

	MediaWiki 1.15.1
	Semantic Mediawiki 1.4.x
	SMW Halo 1.4.x
	ParserFunctions
	SemanticResultFormats (especially "Math")


Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install CE is using the deployment framework:

 smwadmin -i collaboration

This installs the extension.

For a manual installation, you have to copy the folder Collaboration into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. Collaboration will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

Activating Collaboration
------------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/Collaboration/includes/CE_Initialize.php');
enableCollaborationExtension();

Import of the ontology
----------------------

The Collaboration extension comes with an own small onotlogy to provide functionality
for displaying and querying existing comments.

For that go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/Collaboration/import/collaboration.xml'

Now you can enter {{ShowComments}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related comments' and a form that allows you to enter new comments. 


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in /includes/CE_Initialize.php.

To reformat the comment form, use the provided Cascading Style Sheet in '/skins' directory.
To reformat the display of existing comments take a look at 'Template:CommentResult'.


Notice
======
It's highly recommended that you do not change the css definitions 'height' and 'width'
for 'div.ce_result_user'. It's used to downscale the user icon. Changing or deleting
these values could lead to unintended GUI results.
