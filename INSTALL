Installation instructions for Collaboration extension v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.15.1

Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install CE is using the deployment framework:

 smwadmin -i collaboration

This installs the extension.

For a manual installation, you have to copy the folder Collaboration into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. Collaboration will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

However, you can apply a patch to the used extensions:
* patch.txt: 
	This patch contains changes to ArticleComment, RatingBar and CurrentUsers


Updating the database
---------------------

The Collaboration extension requires some additional tables in the database that must
be added to the existing database schema. Existing data will not be modified.
Therefore change into the maintenance folder of the Collaboration extension and run the
setup script:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/Collaboration/maintenance
 php CE_Setup.php


Activating Collaboration
------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/Collaboration/includes/CE_Initialize.php');


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in CE_Initialize.php.
